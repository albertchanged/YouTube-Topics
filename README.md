# YouTube Topics ♫

A great tool for you to find and listen to your favorite songs in the highest quality possible on YouTube!

The search results dynamically update when you type in the textbox without interfering with the current video. This creates an convenient and fun experience for you and your ears.

Project involves React JS, Webpack, YouTube Data API, and Bootstrap.
